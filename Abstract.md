Plasma donation is a critical lifeline for patients with various medical conditions, and its significance in healthcare cannot be overstated. However, the process of plasma donation presents challenges that affect both donors and healthcare providers. In response to these challenges, we have developed the Plasma Donor Applicationâ€”a pioneering solution aimed at transforming the landscape of plasma donation. This project's primary objective is to improve the entire plasma donation experience by addressing key pain points in the process. We have designed an innovative application that seamlessly integrates with the donation process, providing donors with a user-friendly interface and healthcare providers with enhanced management capabilities.
